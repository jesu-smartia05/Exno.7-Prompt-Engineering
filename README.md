# Aim:
To Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.



# Algorithm: 
Develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

# Output:

## 🔹 Step 1: Define the Purpose

Ask:

What personal needs will this app serve?
(e.g., learning support, brainstorming, coding help, journaling, idea generation, productivity).

Who will use it? Just you, or others too?

Should it be web, mobile, or desktop?

👉 Example use case: “An app that helps me brainstorm business ideas, refine them, and generate step-by-step plans.”

## 🔹 Step 2: Core Features

Prompt Library → Curated set of reusable prompts for different tasks.

Customizable Prompts → User can edit prompts according to context.

Adaptive Responses → App adjusts style/tone based on user profile (formal, creative, technical).

Creativity Tools → Idea expansion, analogies, what-if scenarios.

Problem-Solving Tools → Structured outputs like pros/cons, stepwise reasoning, checklists, diagrams.

Memory (optional) → Store past sessions, recall user preferences.

## 🔹 Step 3: Technical Design

Frontend:

Minimal UI (React, Flutter, or Streamlit for quick prototyping).

Input box for prompts, results area for responses.

Prompt categories (creative writing, productivity, coding, learning, etc.).

Backend:

API call to LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source LLM like LLaMA via HuggingFace).

Middleware for formatting structured outputs (tables, lists, flowcharts).

User profile + history storage (SQLite/Postgres/Firebase).

Integration:

Export results (PDF, DOCX, Markdown).

Optional voice input/output.

## 🔹 Step 4: Example Workflow

User selects “Brainstorming” mode.

App shows tailored prompt: “Generate 5 innovative solutions for [problem] considering [constraints].”

User inputs: “How to reduce traffic congestion in cities with limited budget.”

LLM responds with structured solutions.

User refines → “Expand #3 into a step-by-step pilot project.”

App saves this as a custom prompt template.

## 🔹 Step 5: Expand for Creativity & Problem-Solving

Creativity Booster: Random twist button (“Add a sci-fi element”, “Make it eco-friendly”, etc.).

Problem-Solver Mode: Auto-output structured formats:

Root-cause analysis (Why-Why tree)

SWOT analysis

Decision matrix

## 🔹 Step 6: Tools & Stack Suggestions

Fast prototype: Streamlit / Gradio (Python).

Full app: React + Node.js + LLM API.

Offline / open-source: Ollama (for Mac), LM Studio, or HuggingFace Transformers.

Optional AI workflow manager: LangChain or LlamaIndex.

✅ This way, you’ll get a personalized prompt-based app that is more than just a chatbot — it becomes a creative partner + problem-solving assistant.


# Result:
The Prompt is executed successfully
